</h3> <p>is an invitation to take a look at contemporary history from the perspective of Asia and the Pacific in this moment of global uncertainty and a crumbling of the western order that dominated for centuries. The show’s artists pose courageous questions and thoughtfully explore the new, fragmented reality of our world today. The shows narrative is focused on the multilateral flow and exchange of ideas, resources, and forms throughout the region of Asia and the Pacific. Realities that have defined this expansive, culturally and religiously diverse region united by two bodies of water, the Pacific and Indian Oceans, for hundreds of years are now part of a global conversation: mobility</p></div>

Organized by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, the exhibition is a major retrospective of his paintings, featuring fifty works that span three decades of his career, from the artist’s earliest mature works to his recent, monumentally scaled paintings.</p>
